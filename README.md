## To Run it:

After you clone it, make sure you're in the directory in terminal and run `npm install`. After it's done installing all the node modules it will run `bower install` for you.

Once this is done, you should be able to run `grunt serve`. This will open it up in your browser and you should see a Welcome to Yeogurt page.
